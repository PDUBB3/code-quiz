## Description

In this project, I was tasked to create a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that progress can be compared to my peers on a highscores page.

I had used HTML, CSS and javascript to code this application and creating this quiz.
The quiz contains 5 questions. Once the user starts the quiz, the timer is automatically initiated and the first question with 5 answer choices appear on the screen. If the user clicks on a correct, they move onto the next question. If they click on a incorrect answer, they will not move onto the next question and 5 second will be deducted from the remaining time for completing the quiz. Once they have completed the quiz, the user can enter their initials onto the scoreboard.

## What did we do?

Create files from scratch our selves
include the following elements into our quiz

- [x] When I click the start button, a timer wil start and I will be presented with a question
- [x] When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question
- [x] When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
- [x] When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over
- [x] When the game is over. then I can save my initials and my score
